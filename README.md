Test Your Kotlin Gyan

App Description:

This a Kotlin Quiz App which tests our Kotlin Knowledge gained.

Kotlin is used as primary language for building this android application.

There are a lot of kotlin concepts incorporated while building this app to mention some:

(i)Kotlin data classes were used in building the data model for the application as i just needed only member variables holding data for  my application
   in few places and really did not needed the whole class itself.
   
(ii)Kotlin lambda function really made the code very easy to read and most importantly helped in getting rid of the excessive code 
    needed for event handlers.
    
(iii) kotlinx made a lot of things simpler when dealing with the android activities like we need not use findviewbyid() instead 
      directly we can refer the activity controls.
      
(iv) kotlin 'object' saved me from writing lots of singleton class code

(v) The mutable map and the immutable list helped in dealing with the in memory data appropriately.

(vi) And of course used the 'val' and 'var' variables used through out the code
